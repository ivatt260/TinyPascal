# Interpreter for the RCA 1802
This interpreter currently works on Lee Hart's "MemberSHIP" and "MemberCHIP" cards.

I/O is performed directly, via SCRT routines, to/from the I/O port on these cards.

Changing the SCRT call for other cards should be relatively easy, but I do not have hardware to test. Edits, etc. more than welcome.
